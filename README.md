This is an university project about CubeSat. We're using ARM Cortex M4, C++ language and SW Atmel Studio 6.1

Objective

The final objective that graduation project is nano satellite development called Cubesat which is capable of performing and control experiments in astrobiology.

Methodology

For the successful completion of this project, it was divided into sub-systems, namely: • DPU – Digital Processing Unit • Potency • Communication • Actuators • Cube • Experience under test in astrobiology

DPU – Consists of a versatile multiprocessor platform with 4 cores, low energy consumption, high processing capacity, extern interface for sensors and actuators.

Potency – Platform able to provide all the power needed for the proper functioning of cubesat, converting solar energy into electricity, by means of photovoltaic cells.

Communication – Platform responsible for the transmission and reception of data between cubesat and earth station.

Actuators – Control platform responsible for the appointment of nano satellite in space, made by reaction wheels.

Cube – Mechanical structure that accommodate robust and compact form for the standardized dimensions nano satellite 10x10x10 (cm) all components of the project.

Experience under test in astrobiology – Experience in astrobiology kindly provide by professor Vanderlei Parro that has needed to be done and validated in free space.
